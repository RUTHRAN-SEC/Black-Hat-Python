# Netcat (Python TCP Networking Tool)

## Project Description

This project is a Python-based implementation of a Netcat-like networking tool. 
It allows users to create TCP client and server connections for sending data, executing remote commands, uploading files, and interacting through a command shell.

The tool supports both client mode and server (listen) mode, 
making it useful for learning low-level networking concepts and basic security testing techniques.

## Learning Objectives
+ Understand how TCP client-server communication works
+ Learn how sockets are used in Python
+ Explore command-line argument parsing using argparse
+ Learn multi-threading to handle multiple clients
+ Understand how Netcat is used in networking and cybersecurity
+ Practice safe command execution and data transfer concepts

## Requirements for the Project
+ Basic knowledge of Python programming
+ Understanding of IP addresses and ports
+ Familiarity with command-line usage
+ Basic knowledge of TCP/IP networking
+ Interest in networking or cybersecurity concepts

### Software Requirements
+ Python 3.14
+ Any operating system that supports Python: Windows,Linux,macOS
+ Terminal / Command Prompt

### Python Libraries Used
This project uses only built-in Python libraries:
+ socket – for network communication
+ argparse – for command-line arguments
+ threading – to handle multiple clients
+ subprocess – to execute system commands
+ shlex – for secure command parsing
+ sys – for system-level operations
+ textwrap – for formatting help text
+ No external libraries are required.

### System Requirements
+ Minimum 2 GB RAM
+ Any modern CPU
+ Network access (LAN or localhost)
+ Python installed and added to system PATH

### Security Relevance
This project is highly relevant in the field of Cybersecurity:
⚠️ This tool should be used only in controlled environments such as labs or personal test systems.
+ Demonstrates how attackers and defenders use Netcat
+ Helps understand reverse shells and bind shells
+ Useful for learning penetration testing basics
+ Shows how insecure services can be exploited
+ Helps SOC analysts understand malicious remote access behavior

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
