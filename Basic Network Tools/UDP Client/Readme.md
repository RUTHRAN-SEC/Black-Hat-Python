# UDP Client using Python


## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) client using Python socket programming. 
The UDP client sends datagrams to a target host and port without establishing a persistent connection and receives responses from the server.

The project helps learners understand connection-less communication, how data is transmitted over UDP
and how applications interact with network services where speed is prioritized over reliability.

## Learning Objectives
+ Understand UDP and connection-less communication
+ Learn how UDP clients send and receive data
+ Explore socket programming using Python
+ Compare UDP and TCP behavior
+ Understand real-world use cases of UDP
+ Build a foundation for network security analysis

## Requirements for the Project

+ Basic knowledge of Python programming
+ Understanding of IP addresses and ports
+ Familiarity with networking fundamentals
+ Authorized environment for testing

## Software Requirements
+ Python 3.14
+ Code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, etc.)
+ Terminal or Command Prompt

### Python Libraries Used
+ socket – for UDP-based network communication
+ (Uses only Python standard libraries)

### System Requirements
+ Windows / Linux / macOS
+ Network interface enabled
+ Minimum 4 GB RAM (recommended)

### Security Relevance
Understanding UDP client behavior is important in cybersecurity. This project helps learners:
+ Analyze UDP-based network traffic
+ Detect suspicious or malicious UDP communication
+ Understand how attackers use UDP for scanning and data exfiltration
+ Improve SOC monitoring and network analysis skills
+ Investigate UDP traffic using tools like Wireshark
