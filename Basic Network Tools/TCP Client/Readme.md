# Project: TCP Client using Python

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a TCP client using Python to establish communication with a remote server over a network. The TCP client connects to a specified IP address and port, sends data to the server, and receives responses in a reliable, connection oriented manner.

The project helps in understanding core networking concepts such as TCP handshakes, client-server architecture, sockets, and data transmission. It is especially useful for cybersecurity learners to understand how attackers and defenders interact with network services during scanning, exploitation, and command-and-control communication.

This project forms a foundational skill for penetration testing, malware analysis, and SOC investigations.

## Learning Objectives

+ Understand TCP client-server communication
+ Learn how data is sent and received over TCP
+ Analyze how network-based attacks and tools communicate
+ Build a base for advanced security scripts

## Requirements for the Project

### Software Requirements
+ Python 3.14
+ Any code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, etc.)
+ Command Line / Terminal

### Python Libraries Used
+ socket (for TCP communication)
+ sys (optional, for arguments and exit handling)
+ (All libraries are part of Python’s standard library)

### System Requirements
+ Windows / Linux / macOS
+ Basic networking enabled (loopback or local network)

## Security Relevance

+ Helps understand how backdoors, reverse shells, and C2 clients work
+ Useful for analyzing network traffic in Wireshark
+ Builds foundational knowledge for red team and blue team roles
