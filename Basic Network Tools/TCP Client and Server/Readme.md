# TCP Client and Server using Python


## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a TCP client and server using Python sockets to enable reliable 
connection-oriented communication between two systems. The server listens for incoming client connections  
handles multiple clients using threading, and processes data sent by clients. The client establishes a connection to the server
sends requests and receives responses.

The project provides a strong foundation for understanding network communication, 
client-server architecture, and how network-based tools operate in cybersecurity environments.

## Learning Objectives

+ Understand TCP/IP communication fundamentals
+ Learn client-server architecture
+ Explore socket programming in Python
+ Understand how data is transmitted over networks
+ Build a foundation for network security and penetration testing
+ Analyze how network services interact in real-world systems

## Requirements for the Project

+ Basic knowledge of Python programming
+ Understanding of networking concepts (IP, ports, TCP)
+ Command-line usage
+ Ethical and authorized testing environment

## Software Requirements

+ Python 3.14
+ Code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, etc.)
+ Terminal or Command Prompt

### Python Libraries Used
+ socket – for TCP communication
+ threading – for handling multiple client connections concurrently
+ (All libraries are part of Python’s standard library)

### System Requirements

+ Windows / Linux / macOS
+ Minimum 4 GB RAM (recommended)
+ Network interface enabled (local or loopback network)

### Security Relevance
Understanding TCP client-server communication is critical in cybersecurity. This project helps learners:
+ Analyze how attackers communicate with services
+ Understand backdoors, reverse shells, and command-and-control traffic
+ Detect suspicious network activity
+ Perform network traffic analysis using tools like Wireshark
+ Strengthen defensive monitoring and response skills
